# Deployment Guide

## Local Build

```powershell
npm run build
```

The static build is generated in `dist/`.

## AWS Static Hosting Target

For this prototype release, static hosting is preferred:

1. Create an S3 bucket.
2. Enable static website hosting.
3. Upload `dist/`.
4. Configure a public-read bucket policy for website assets if acceptable for the account.

## Production Upgrade Path

Before handling real GRC data, move to:

- CloudFront in front of S3.
- AWS WAF for public edge protection.
- Cognito or enterprise SSO for authentication.
- Backend API for graph mutations.
- Server-side evidence storage with S3 Object Lock.
- Structured audit logging.
